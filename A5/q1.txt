The angels are in a live lock, as the angels all locking at each other stops them from moving. There is no shared
resource which one has that the others dont have, instead each one is looking at one (or more angels) and thus those
other angels cant move either. This will continue indefinably as in order for the state to change one of the angels
needs to move, but in order to move the angel needs to not be looked at (state to change).
