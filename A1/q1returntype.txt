1bi) We get the following output for the different programs
(Running the function /usr/bin/time -f "%Uu %Ss %E" ./abx 500000000 10000 1003):

Throw Catch     (with compiler optimization): 22.42u
Throw Catch  (without compiler optimization): 42.49u

Status Flags    (with compiler optimization): 18.91u
Status Flags (without compiler optimization): 22.74u

Variants        (with compiler optimization): 30.26u
Variants     (without compiler optimization): 87.35u

Tagged Union    (with compiler optimization): 18.94u
Tagged Union (without compiler optimization): 23.78u

1bii) The global status flags preform better then the original program. This is due to the fact that flags can be
modified and checked in O(1) time, exceptions require a bit more processing time.

The variants perform worse then the original program. This could be due to the fact that checking variants
can take alot of time and we do it at each level, so exceptions can run faster.

The tagged union preforms better then the original program. This is because since its passed to each function and only
created once, we can change and access values very quickly so its preforms better then exceptions.

1biii) The global status flags preform better then the original program with compiler optimization. This is due to the
fact that flags can be modified and checked in O(1) time, exceptions require a bit more processing time, although the
difference is alot smaller.

The variants perform worse then the original program with compiler optimization. This could be due to the fact that
checking variants can take alot of time and we do it at each level, so exceptions can run faster but not by much.

The tagged union preforms better then the original program with compiler optimization. This is because since its
passed to each function and only created once, we can change and access values very quickly so its preforms
better then exceptions but not by as much as before.

1ci) We get the following timings for exception periods:

Throw Catch      (1000): 46.18u
Throw Catch       (100): 70.55u
Throw Catch        (50): 96.73u

Status Flags     (1000): 41.76u
Status Flags      (100): 41.70u
Status Flags       (50): 40.53u

Variants         (1000): 58.49u
Variants          (100): 58.16u
Variants           (50): 57.40u

Tagged Union     (1000): 42.28u
Tagged Union      (100): 41.83u
Tagged Union       (50): 41.11u

1cii) As the exception period decreases (more exceptions occur) we note that the amount of time the
original program takes increase by a large margin. However since exceptions have a very small impact
on performance on all of our other modified programs the exception period does not really impact the
amount of time required to execute.
